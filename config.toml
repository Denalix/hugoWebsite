      - title: Design of a robotic cell to simulate a plastic inyection process with robot studio
        content: The objective of the project is to design and simulate a robotic cell capable of performing basic tasks in the plastics treatment process using the robotic cell design tools studied in the course such as RobotStudio. In order to carry out this process, a robot selection process, final effector and injection machine modeling are performed. The final result is the simulation of the plastic treatment procedure using two robots where all the processes applied to the part are shown.

      - title: Heliodon
        content: This project is built because of the need to analyze the behavior of sunlight falling on different types of structures, it is proposed the realization of a Heliodon model that allows to represent the dynamics of this behavior at scale and is able to meet customer requirements (teachers) as the location of a single light source in a specific position of the sun, constant movement of the light source at a given constant speed, in addition, it must meet space, budget, time and quality restrictions, among others, and can be used by undergraduate students of the National University of Colombia in the Agricultural Engineering laboratory.
